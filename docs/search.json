I calculate the average for the compound, positive, negative, and neutral scores for each year.\nThe resulting table shows that the overall compound sentiment is consistently negative across all years, but it becomes even more negative from 2023 to 2025. This suggests that the language in these subreddits has grown more negative in the post-pandemic period compared to during the pandemic itself.\n\n\nCode\n# Group by COVID period\nperiod_statement = reddit_df.groupby('covid_period').agg({\n    'compound': ['mean', 'std', 'count'],\n    'negative': 'mean',\n    'positive': 'mean'\n}).round(4)\n\nprint(\"Sentiment by COVID Period\")\nprint(period_statement)\n\n\nSentiment by COVID Period\n             compound                negative positive\n                 mean     std  count     mean     mean\ncovid_period                                          \nDuring COVID  -0.1967  0.6350  10517   0.1624   0.1049\nPost-COVID    -0.2485  0.7024   6218   0.1600   0.1073\nPre-COVID     -0.1463  0.6532    576   0.1747   0.1142\n\n\nThis code groups all my posts into the ‘Pre-COVID’, ‘During COVID’, and ‘Post-COVID’ periods. For each period, it’s calculating the average compound, negative, and positive scores. It also gets the standard deviation (std) and post count for the main compound score to check for consistency and data volume.\nThis output clearly shows that the overall sentiment (compound score) became more negative during the pandemic (-0.1967) compared to the ‘Pre-COVID’ period (-0.1463). More importantly, the sentiment in the ‘Post-COVID’ period (-0.2485) is even more negative than it was during the pandemic. This suggests that the collective mental health discourse in these subreddits has not improved and has, in fact, trended further into negative territory.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers.default = \"notebook\"\n\n# Create the base line plot\nfig = px.line(\n    yearly_sentiment,\n    x=yearly_sentiment.index,\n    y=\"compound\",\n    markers=True,  # Creates the 'o' markers\n    text=\"compound\",  # Use the 'compound' column for text labels\n    # Set titles and labels\n    title=\"Reddit Mental Health Sentiment Over Time\",\n    labels={\n        \"index\": \"Year\",  # 'index' because we passed the index as x\n        \"compound\": \"Average Compound Sentiment Score\",\n    },\n)\n\n# Add the vertical 'COVID Start' line\nfig.add_vline(\n    x=2020,\n    line_dash=\"dash\",  # Replaces 'linestyle'\n    line_color=\"red\",  # Replaces 'color'\n    annotation_text=\"COVID Start\",  # This is Plotly's 'label'\n    annotation_position=\"top right\",\n)\n\n# Format the text labels on the points\nfig.update_traces(\n    textposition=\"bottom right\",  # Matches 'ha='center', va='bottom'\n    texttemplate=\"%{text:.3f}\",  # Formats the text like '{score:.3f}'\n)\n\n# Adjust layout size and grid (Plotly's grid is on by default)\nfig.update_layout(\n    width=1000,  # Roughly matches figsize=(10, 6)\n    height=600,\n    xaxis_gridcolor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.1)\",  # Lighter grid, like 'alpha=0.3'\n    yaxis_gridcolor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.1)\",\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nThe data seems to show that the pandemic’s impact on mental health wasn’t a temporary event that ended when the lockdowns lifted. Instead, it appears to have introduced or amplified long term negative scores. While the acute anxiety of the virus and lockdowns faded, they were replaced by chronic issues like economic inflation, job instability, and the stress of “returning to normal”, which created a new set of anxieties as we’ll later explore in this dataset.\nFurthermore, the prolonged social isolation may have caused lasting damage to social structures and individual well-being, leading to persistent loneliness and disconnection. The data suggests we are now living with the compounded consequences of the pandemic, which are proving to be just as, or even more, detrimental to collective mental health than the initial crisis itself.\n\n\nCode\n# Check data distribution\nprint(\"Posts per year:\")\nprint(reddit_df['year'].value_counts().sort_index())\n\n# Compare pre vs during COVID (if you have that data)\nprint(\"\\nAverage compound sentiment by period:\")\nfor period in ['Pre-COVID', 'During COVID', 'Post-COVID']:\n    data = reddit_df[reddit_df['covid_period'] == period]\n    if len(data) &gt; 0:\n        print(f\"{period}: {data['compound'].mean():.4f} (n={len(data)})\")\n\n\nPosts per year:\nyear\n2020    3536\n2021    3567\n2022    3159\n2023    2775\n2024    2993\n2025    1281\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\nAverage compound sentiment by period:\nPre-COVID: -0.1463 (n=576)\nDuring COVID: -0.1967 (n=10517)\nPost-COVID: -0.2485 (n=6218)\n\n\nI have a solid collection of posts, with thousands from each year between 2020 and 2024. The lower number for 2025 just means I ran the data collection part-way through that year.\nThe average sentiment was already negative Pre-COVID (-0.1463) but became significantly more negative During COVID (-0.1967). Most importantly, instead of recovering, the sentiment has grown even more negative in the Post-COVID period (-0.2485), suggesting that the pandemic has had a lasting and worsening impact on the mental health discourse in these subreddits.\n\n\nCode\nreddit_sent_df = reddit_df\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%store reddit_sent_df\n\n\nStored 'reddit_sent_df' (DataFrame)",

This reflects both the volume increase (18x more posts) and a slight intensification of emotional expression.\nConsistency Across Periods: The top 10 words are remarkably similar across all three periods. “Feel,” “know,” “anxiety,” “life,” “time,” “people,” and “help” dominate all three lists, suggesting these are core themes in mental health discussions regardless of external circumstances.\nProportional Analysis: Pre-COVID: “anxiety” appears 243 times (0.70 times per post on average)\nDuring COVID: “anxiety” appears 4,401 times (0.42 times per post)\nPost-COVID: “anxiety” appears 3,813 times (0.61 times per post)\nInterestingly, “anxiety” was mentioned proportionally less per post during COVID, possibly because discussions became more varied (including topics like isolation, work, school) rather than purely anxiety-focused.\nNew Words: “One” and “think” enter the top 10 during and after COVID, suggesting more reflective, cognitive language emerged during the pandemic.\n\n\nCode\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwordcloud_pre_covid = WordCloud(\n    width=800,\n    height=400,\n    background_color=\"white\",\n    colormap=\"viridis\",\n    max_words=100\n).generate_from_frequencies(period_word_counts[\"Pre-COVID\"])\n\nwordcloud_during_covid = WordCloud(\n    width=800,\n    height=400,\n    background_color=\"white\",\n    colormap=\"viridis\",\n    max_words=100\n).generate_from_frequencies(period_word_counts[\"During COVID\"])\n\nwordcloud_post_covid = WordCloud(\n    width=800,\n    height=400,\n    background_color=\"white\",\n    colormap=\"viridis\",\n    max_words=100\n).generate_from_frequencies(period_word_counts[\"Post-COVID\"])\n\n\nThis creates visual word clouds where word size corresponds to frequency. The viridis colormap provides a gradient from purple to yellow, and max_words=100 limits the display to the 100 most frequent words.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.imshow(wordcloud_pre_covid, interpolation=\"bilinear\")\nplt.title(\"World Cloud, Pre-COVID\")\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.show()",

During COVID it was only slightly elevated (5.0), but post-COVID saw massive increase in words like “tired,” “anymore,” “hate,” and “end.” This suggests depression communities are experiencing severe exhaustion and possibly increased suicidal ideation in the aftermath of COVID.\nParadoxically, r/Anxiety’s burnout remained completely flat (~2.2 across all periods), suggesting anxiety manifests more as acute distress rather than chronic exhaustion. r/mentalhealth also remained stable, possibly because it’s a more solutions-focused community.",

The slight increase during COVID likely reflects telehealth discussions.\nr/Anxiety shows a U-shaped pattern: therapy mentions dropped during COVID (0.95 → 0.7), possibly because acute crisis posts crowded out treatment discussions, then rebounded post-COVID to baseline levels.\nr/depression showed modest increases, suggesting growing treatment-seeking behavior.

The Anxiety-to-Depression Pipeline:\nThe progression from acute anxiety during COVID to severe burnout/depression post-COVID across the overall dataset might represent a temporal mental health cascade:\n\nAcute COVID stress → increased anxiety (health fears, uncertainty)\nProlonged stress → exhaustion, decreased coping\nPost-COVID reality → burnout, depression, hopelessness\n\nThis aligns with research showing chronic anxiety can lead to depression when stressors persist without resolution.",

It searches a specific subreddit for posts made between a start_time and end_time, returning up to 100 of the oldest posts first. The function handles errors or empty results by returning an empty list.\n\n\nCode\ndef get_pushshift_monthly_chunk(subreddit, start_time, end_time, limit=100):\n    \"\"\"Fetch a single chunk of data from Pushshift API\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/submission\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"subreddit\": subreddit,\n        \"after\": int(start_time.timestamp()),\n        \"before\": int(end_time.timestamp()),\n        \"size\": limit,  # Fetch up to 'limit' posts (max 100)\n        \"sort\": \"asc\",\n        \"sort_type\": \"created_utc\",\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        data = response.json()\n\n        if \"data\" not in data or len(data[\"data\"]) == 0:\n            return []  # Return an empty list if no posts\n\n        return data[\"data\"]  # Return the list of posts found\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching chunk: {e}\")\n        return []  # Return an empty list on error\n\n\nAlright, so to start my main data collection, I first set up these variables. I create an empty list called all_posts which is where I’ll store all the data as I gather it. I then define the total time window I want to analyze, setting the start_date to January 1, 2020, and the end_date to the current time.\n\n\nCode\nall_posts = []\nstart_date = datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)\nend_date = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)\ncurrent_start = start_date\n\n\nThis is the main data collection loop from my collecting_over_5_years.ipynb notebook, which iterates month by month from January 2020 until the present. For each month, I loop through my three target subreddits (r/depression, r/mentalhealth, and r/Anxiety) and call the get_pushshift_monthly_chunk function to fetch 100 posts from each. I add these new posts to my main all_posts list and include a 3-second time.sleep call to avoid overwhelming the API.\n\n\nCode\nprint(\n    f\"Collecting up to 100 posts per month from {start_date.date()} to {end_date.date()}...\"\n)\n\nsubreddits_to_fetch = [\"depression\", \"mentalhealth\", \"Anxiety\"]\n\nwhile current_start &lt; end_date:\n    # 1. Calculate the end of the current month\n    if current_start.month == 12:\n        next_month_start = current_start.replace(\n            year=current_start.year + 1, month=1, day=1\n        )\n    else:\n        next_month_start = current_start.replace(month=current_start.month + 1, day=1)\n\n    current_end = next_month_start - datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)\n\n    # 2. Ensure our end date doesn't go into the future\n    if current_end &gt; end_date:\n        current_end = end_date\n\n    # 3. Fetch the chunk for this month\n    print(f\"--- Fetching for {current_start.date()} to {current_end.date()} ---\")\n    \n    for subreddit_name in subreddits_to_fetch:\n        print(f\"Fetching r/{subreddit_name}...\")\n\n        # Call our modified function for this month's window\n        posts_chunk = get_pushshift_monthly_chunk(\n            subreddit_name, current_start, current_end, limit=100\n        )\n\n        all_posts.extend(posts_chunk)\n\n        print(f\"...found {len(posts_chunk)} posts.
